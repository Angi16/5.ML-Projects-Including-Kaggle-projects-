    "In this project, we will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. We train different models on this data and whichever is found a good fit could then be used to make certain predictions about a home â€” in particular, its monetary value.\n",

    "* 16 data points have an 'MEDV' value of 50.0. These data points contain missing or censored values and have been removed.\n",
    "* 1 data point has an 'RM' value of 8.78. This data point can be considered an outlier and has been removed.\n",
    "* The features 'RM', 'LSTAT', 'PTRATIO', and 'MEDV' are essential. The remaining non-relevant features have been excluded.\n",
    "* The feature 'MEDV' has been multiplicatively scaled to account for 35 years of market inflation.\n",
